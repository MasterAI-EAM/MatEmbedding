AlLiO2,lithium aluminate,"Lithium aluminate (LiAlO2), also called lithium aluminium oxide, is an inorganic chemical compound, an aluminate of lithium.  In microelectronics, lithium aluminate is considered as a lattice matching substrate for gallium nitride.[citation needed] In nuclear technology, lithium aluminate is of interest as a solid tritium breeder material, for preparing tritium fuel for nuclear fusion.[citation needed]

Lithium aluminate is a layered double hydroxide (LDH) with a crystal structure resembling that of hydrotalcite.[dubious  – discuss][clarification needed] Lithium aluminate solubility at high pH (12.5 – 13.5) is much lower than that of aluminium oxides. In the conditioning of low- and intermediate level radioactive waste (LILW), lithium nitrate is sometimes used as additive to cement to minimise aluminium corrosion at high pH and subsequent hydrogen production. Indeed, upon addition of lithium nitrate to cement, a passive layer of LiH(AlO2)2 · 5 H2O is formed onto the surface of metallic aluminium waste immobilised in mortar. The lithium aluminate layer is insoluble in cement pore water and protects the underlying aluminium oxide covering the metallic aluminium from dissolution at high pH. It is also a pore filler. This hinders the aluminium oxidation by the protons of water and reduces the hydrogen evolution rate by a factor of 10.

Given its density, and with hydrogen content on the order of 10% by weight, some forms of alane are, as of 2016, active candidates for storing hydrogen and so for power generation in fuel cell applications, including electric vehicles.[not verified in body] As of 2006 it was noted that further research was required to identify an efficient, economical way to reverse the process, regenerating alane from spent aluminium product.

A solid crystalline substance, cubane is one of the Platonic hydrocarbons and a member of the prismanes. It was first synthesized in 1964 by Philip Eaton and Thomas Cole. Before this work, Eaton believed that cubane would be impossible to synthesize due to the ""required 90 degree bond angles"". The cubic shape requires the carbon atoms to adopt an unusually sharp 90° bonding angle, which would be highly strained as compared to the 109.45° angle of a tetrahedral carbon. Once formed, cubane is quite kinetically stable, due to a lack of readily available decomposition paths. It is the simplest hydrocarbon with octahedral symmetry.

C131H200N30O43S2,amidorphin,"Amidorphin is an endogenous, C-terminally amidated, opioid peptide generated as a cleavage product of proenkephalin A in some mammalian species; in humans and most other species, the peptide is 1 residue longer and is not amidated. Amidorphin is widely distributed in the mammalian brain, with particularly high concentrations found in the striatum, and outside of the brain in adrenal medulla and posterior pituitary. The 26-residue peptide named amidorphin is found in several species including bovine (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries), and pig (Sus scrofa). Humans and commonly studied lab animals (mice, rats) produce a 27-residue peptide that does not have an amidated C-terminal residue; this is due to the absence of a Gly in the precursor sequence and replacement with Ala, which is not a substrate for the amidating enzyme (Peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase). The properties of the 27-residue peptide are presumably similar to those of amidorphin, although this has not been adequately tested.

HDO,semiheavy water  water-d1,"Semiheavy water is the result of replacing one of the protium in light water with deuterium. It exists whenever there is water with light hydrogen (protium, 1H) and deuterium (D or 2H) in the mix. This is because hydrogen atoms (hydrogen-1 and deuterium) are rapidly exchanged between water molecules. Water containing 50% H and 50% D in its hydrogen contains about 50% HDO and 25% each of H2O and D2O, in dynamic equilibrium.
In regular water, about 1 molecule in 3,200 is HDO (one hydrogen in 6,400 is D). By comparison, heavy water D2O occurs at a proportion of about 1 molecule in 41 million (i.e., one in 6,4002). This makes semiheavy water far more common than ""normal"" heavy water.

H3O+,hydronium ion,"In chemistry, hydronium (hydroxonium in traditional British English) is the common name for the cation [H3O]+, also written as H3O+, the type of oxonium ion produced by protonation of water. It is often viewed as the positive ion present when an Arrhenius acid is dissolved in water, as Arrhenius acid molecules in solution give up a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, H+) to the surrounding water molecules (H2O). In fact, acids must be surrounded by more than a single water molecule in order to ionize, yielding aqueous H+ and conjugate base. Three main structures for the aqueous proton have garnered experimental support: the Eigen cation, which is a tetrahydrate, H3O+(H2O)3, the Zundel cation, which is a symmetric dihydrate, H+(H2O)2, and the Stoyanov cation, an expanded Zundel cation, which is a hexahydrate: H+(H2O)2(H2O)4. Spectroscopic evidence from well-defined IR spectra overwhelmingly supports the Stoyanov cation as the predominant form. For this reason, it has been suggested that wherever possible, the symbol H+(aq) should be used instead of the hydronium ion.

ZrC,zirconium carbide,"Zirconium carbide (ZrC) is an extremely hard refractory ceramic material, commercially used in tool bits for cutting tools. It is usually processed by sintering.
"
ZnWO4,zinc orthotungstate,NO DESCRIPTION
ZrCl4,zirconium tetrachloride,"Zirconium(IV) chloride, also known as zirconium tetrachloride, (ZrCl4) is an inorganic compound frequently used as a precursor to other compounds of zirconium. This white high-melting solid hydrolyzes rapidly in humid air.
"
ZrI4,zirconium iodide,NO DESCRIPTION
ZrN,zirconium nitride,"Zirconium nitride (ZrN) is an inorganic compound used in a variety of ways due to its properties.
"
Zr(NO3)4,zirconium(IV) nitrate,"Zirconium nitrate is a volatile anhydrous transition metal nitrate salt of zirconium with formula Zr(NO3)4. It has alternate names of zirconium tetranitrate, or zirconium(IV) nitrate.
"
Zr(OH)4,zirconium hydroxide,"Zirconium (IV) hydroxide,  often called hydrous zirconia is an ill-defined material or family of materials variously described as ZrO2·nH2O and Zr(OH)4·nH2O.  All are white solids with low solubility in water.  These materials are widely employed in the preparation of solid acid catalysts.
"
ZrO2,zirconium dioxide  baddeleyite,"Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), sometimes known as zirconia (not to be confused with zircon), is a white crystalline oxide of zirconium. Its most naturally occurring form, with a monoclinic crystalline structure, is the mineral baddeleyite. A dopant stabilized cubic structured zirconia, cubic zirconia, is synthesized in various colours for use as a gemstone and a diamond simulant.
"
ZrO32−,zirconate ion,"A zirconate is an oxyanion containing zirconium. Examples include Na2ZrO3, CaZrO3 and Cs2ZrO3 which can be prepared by fusing zirconium dioxide with Na2O, CaO[page needed] and CsOH respectively.
"
ZrP2,zirconium phosphide,"Zirconium monophosphide is a binary inorganic compound of zirconium metal and phosphorus with the chemical formula ZrP.
"
ZrS2,zirconium sulfide,NO DESCRIPTION
ZrSi2,zirconium silicide,NO DESCRIPTION
ZrSiO4,zirconium(IV) silicate,"Zirconium silicate, also zirconium orthosilicate, ZrSiO4, is a chemical compound, a silicate of zirconium. It occurs in nature as zircon, a silicate mineral. Powdered zirconium silicate is also known as zircon flour.
"
Zn(SeCN)2,zinc selenocyanate,NO DESCRIPTION
ZrH2,Zirconium(II) hydride,"Zirconium(II) hydride is a molecular chemical compound with the chemical formula ZrH2. It is a grey crystalline solid or dark gray to black powder. It has been prepared by laser ablation and isolated at low temperature.
"
ZnSO4,zinc sulfate,"Zinc sulfate describes a family of inorganic compounds with the formula ZnSO4(H2O)x.  All are colorless solids.  The most common form includes water of crystallization as the heptahydrate, with the formula ZnSO4·7H2O. As early as the 16th century it was prepared on the large scale, and was historically known as ""white vitriol"" (the name was used, for example, in 1620s by the collective writing under the pseudonym of Basil Valentine). Zinc sulfate and its hydrates are colourless solids.
